            All of the iPhone 13 models feature the same OLED Super Re tina XDR
            display, which is flexible and extends right into the chassis of
            each device. There's a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio for blacker blacks
            and brighter whites, and up to 1200 nits peak brightness for HDR

          Asus ROG Phone 5s launched earlier this year and is quite a pricy deal
          if a particu lar user is looking for a smartphone that is built
          specifically for gaming. There are a ton of gaming phones out there,
          but ROG Phones have built their own legacy and brand in the Indian
          market. The Asus ROG Phone 5s carries on with that legacy. However,
          after using it for a few months now, I have figured out some of the
          strong points as well as weak points of the device. Bear with me to
          understand how this device actually is.

          The first one to make it to the list of the best OnePlus mobile phones
          is the OnePlus Nord 2T 5G. The smartphone is in the mid-price range,
          but its specifications are pretty impressive. The phone has a
          6.43-inches screen size and a 1080 x 2400 pixels resolution. It also
          has a peak refresh rate of 90Hz.
